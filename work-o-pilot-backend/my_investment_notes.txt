My Investment Philosophy and Notes - Updated January 2025

APPLE (AAPL) - My Core Holding:
I started investing in Apple in 2018 when the iPhone X was released. My investment thesis is that Apple's ecosystem creates incredible customer loyalty. The Services revenue keeps growing and provides recurring income. I plan to hold AAPL for at least 10 more years.

My Buy Strategy for AAPL:
- I buy more shares whenever the stock drops below the 200-day moving average
- I reinvest all dividends automatically
- My cost basis is around $145 per share
- I never sell Apple shares, only accumulate

NVIDIA (NVDA) - AI Play:
I bought NVIDIA in late 2022 after seeing the potential of AI. This has been my best performing stock. My thesis is that AI computing will need more GPUs for years to come. I'm nervous about the valuation but won't sell.

TESLA (TSLA) - High Risk Position:
Tesla is my smallest position. I believe in the EV transition but worry about competition. I bought during the 2022 crash. This is more speculative than my other holdings.

Portfolio Allocation Goals:
- AAPL should be 50% of my portfolio
- NVDA should be 30%
- TSLA should be 20%

Risk Notes:
I'm worried about interest rates affecting growth stocks. If there's a recession, I plan to buy more of all three positions.
